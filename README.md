## Thought Process
The primary objective of this project was to build an analytics dashboard for a fictional music streaming service, "Streamify," that provides key insights into user activity, revenue generation, and content performance. My approach focused on creating a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing dashboard using modern web technologies.

### Key factors I considered:
- **UI/UX**: The design should be clean, minimal, and adaptable to various screen sizes. Usability and clarity were top priorities.
- **Performance**: Optimizing load times and avoiding unnecessary re-renders were crucial. I implemented lazy loading and code-splitting techniques to improve performance.
- **Interactivity**: I incorporated interactive charts and tables that enable the user to hover over data points for detailed insights and perform sorting and filtering operations.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Mocked Data**: To simulate real-time analytics, I created realistic mock data for user activity, revenue breakdown, and song streaming history.
- **Chart Interactions**: Users can interact with the charts, hover to see details, and filter the data based on selections.

## Instructions to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd streamify-dashboard

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start

4. **View the application in your browser:**
   Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app locally.

**Deploying the app (optional):**
You can deploy this app using services like Vercel or Netlify by connecting your repository and following the hosting service’s deployment instructions.

## Building a Music Streaming Analytics Dashboard

**Dashboard Overview:**
This is a single-page application (SPA) that includes the following sections:

**Key Metrics:**
- Total Users
- Active Users
- Total Streams
- Revenue
- Top Artist

**Data Visualization:**
- User Growth Chart (line chart)
- Revenue Distribution (pie chart)
- Top 5 Streamed Songs (bar chart)

**Data Table:**
- List of recent streams with columns for Song Name, Artist, Date Streamed, Stream Count, and User ID.

**User Interaction Features:**
- Sorting & Filtering: The data table allows sorting by Date or Stream Count and filtering by Artist or Song Name.
- Chart Interactions: Hovering over points in the charts displays exact numbers, and clicking on revenue sources filters the data table.

**Bonus Features:**
- Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
- Optimized Performance: Implemented lazy loading and code splitting to improve load times and minimize re-renders.
